Here one can see that there are few movies that are translated into more than one other languages. There are some quite evident problems in the data that can be seen in this figure. Movies such as \"Harry Potter\", \"The Hunger Games\" and \"Jurassic Parc\" are apparently only available in one language. This is surely wrong, which means that some further preprocessing of the data is necessary if one wants to analyse languages."

    "With this inflation-adjustment trends can be visualized related to the cost of living at that momnent. This shows that the trend of increasing revenues is much less present than initially thought. Another thing that can be seen is the increase in movies at around 1980. After 1980 it seems that movies have a much harder time to make a lot of money. This may also arise because of a bias in the dataset which leads to only successful old movies being included."

    "Zane Grey seems to have understood the way of writing books that are later made into movies. While he is mainly known for western movies, Ian Fleming has gotten to his spot by writing all the \"James Bond\" books. Stephen King is on a well deserved third place with all of his horror movies. This plot shows, that most authors that write books which are adapted often, only write for a very specific niche. This is a sort of winner takes it all effect, which means that in some genres there is one author that will probably have all his books turned into films while most other authors are overlooked."
